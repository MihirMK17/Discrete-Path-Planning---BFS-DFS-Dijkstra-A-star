## BFS (Breadth-First Search)

Breadth-First Search is a simple algorithm to traverse through nodes in a graph. It visits nodes level by level.

## DFS (Depth-First Search)

Depth-First Search is an algorithm to traverse a graph or tree. It visits nodes by diving deeper into the graph before backtracking.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a start node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

### Avoid-East Cost

This cost function prioritizes paths that avoid moving in the eastward direction.

### Avoid-West Cost

This cost function prioritizes paths that avoid moving in the westward direction.

## A* Algorithm

A* is a pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm, which is used to find the shortest path from a start node to a target node.

### Manhattan Distance Heuristic

Manhattan distance is the distance between two points measured along axes at right angles. It is computed as the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates.

### Euclidean Distance Heuristic

Euclidean distance represents the shortest distance between two points in a plane. It is computed using the Pythagorean theorem.
